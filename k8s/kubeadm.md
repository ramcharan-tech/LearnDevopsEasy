`Kubeadm` is a tool built to provide `kubeadm init` and `kubeadm join` as best-practice "fast paths" for creating Kubernetes clusters¹. It performs the actions necessary to get a minimum viable cluster up and running¹. By design, it cares only about bootstrapping, not about provisioning machines¹²³⁴.

Here are some alternatives to `kubeadm`⁵⁶⁷⁸:

1. **Kops**: Kops enables users to create, update, or delete production-grade and highly available Kubernetes clusters from the command line interface⁵. It supports automated infrastructure creation and cluster deployment/provisioning⁵.

2. **Kubespray**: Kubespray is more about generic configuration, initial clustering, and bootstrapping⁵. It uses Ansible playbooks to create, configure, and manage Kubernetes clusters⁵.

3. **Minikube**: Minikube is a tool that makes it easy to run Kubernetes locally. Minikube runs a single-node Kubernetes cluster on your personal computer (including Windows, macOS, and Linux PCs) so you can try out Kubernetes⁸.

4. **Kind**: Kind stands for Kubernetes in Docker. It is a tool for running local Kubernetes clusters using Docker container "nodes". Kind was primarily designed for testing Kubernetes itself, but may be used for local development or CI⁸.

5. **K3s**: K3s is a lightweight Kubernetes distribution designed for developers and edge computing. It is easy to install, half the memory, all in a binary of less than 100MB⁸.

Please note that the exact alternatives supported can vary depending on the version of Kubernetes you are using⁵⁶⁷⁸. For a comprehensive list of all possible alternatives, I recommend referring to the official Kubernetes documentation¹.
