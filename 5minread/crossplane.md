# Terraform vs crossplane

## Terraform: Pros & Cons

### Pros

Mature & Widely Used – Terraform is the de facto standard for IaC, supported by a vast community. \
Multi-Cloud Support – Works with AWS, GCP, Azure, and on-premise infrastructure.
State Management – Uses a centralized state file to track infrastructure changes.
Extensive Provider Ecosystem – Supports thousands of providers for infrastructure resources.\
Declarative & Immutable Infrastructure – Defines infrastructure as code with a predictable state.

### Cons

State File Management – Handling Terraform state can be complex and risky if not managed properly.\
Limited Native Kubernetes Integration – Requires additional tools (like Terraform Kubernetes provider) to integrate deeply with Kubernetes.\
No Built-in Reconciliation – Changes must be applied manually; no automatic drift detection.

## Crossplane: Pros & Cons

### Pros of crossplane

Kubernetes-Native – Uses Kubernetes Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) to manage infrastructure.\
Continuous Reconciliation – Automatically fixes configuration drift without manual intervention.\
GitOps-Friendly – Seamlessly integrates with Kubernetes GitOps workflows.
Composability – Allows developers to define custom infrastructure APIs (Compositions).\
No External State Management – Uses Kubernetes etcd instead of a state file.

### Cons of crossplane

Less Mature than Terraform – Still growing, with a smaller community and fewer integrations.\
Kubernetes Dependency – Requires a Kubernetes cluster to manage infrastructure, which can add overhead.\
Smaller Provider Ecosystem – Fewer built-in providers compared to Terraform
