The -rm -rf option in RUN apt commands is often used in Dockerfiles to remove the APT cache in Debian and Ubuntu-based images1. This is done to reduce the size of the Docker image1. The command RUN rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/* removes the package lists which are used to figure out which packages are available to install1.

The apt clean command is used to clear out the local repository of retrieved package files2. It removes everything but the lock file from /var/cache/apt/archives/ and /var/cache/apt/archives/partial/. When APT is used as a dselect method, clean is run automatically. Those cleaned out packages are generally useless, but they do take up disk space2.

In Docker, it’s common to run apt-get clean after installing packages. This is because Docker images are made up of layers, and each command in a Dockerfile creates a new layer1. The cleanup needs to happen in the same layer as the installation, otherwise, the space won’t actually be reclaimed1.

Here’s an example of how you might use these commands in a Dockerfile:

# Use an official Python runtime as a parent image
FROM python:3.7-slim

# Set the working directory in the container
WORKDIR /app

# Install any needed packages specified in requirements.txt
RUN apt-get update && \
    apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends <your-package-list> && \
    rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/* && \
    apt-get clean
